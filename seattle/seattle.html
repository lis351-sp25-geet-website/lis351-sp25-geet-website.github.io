		<h2>Seattle, WA</h2>

        <p>I found Seattle to be a very cool place, even if it was a bit <span class="rain">rainy.</span></p>
        <p>Some notable landmarks that I took photos of:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://www.pikeplacemarket.org/">Pike Place Market</a></dt>
             <dd>A famous farmer's market located in Seattle's downtown.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.spaceneedle.com/">The Space Needle</a></dt>
             <dd>Arguably the most iconic landmark of Seattle, built for the 1962 World's fair.</dd>
