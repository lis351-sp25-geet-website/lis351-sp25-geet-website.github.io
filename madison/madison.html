		<h2>Madison, WI</h2>

        <p>Well, if it isn't the place I live.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, Madison has a lot of great places and landmarks. However, there is really only one that stands out.</p>
        <p><strong>The Wisconsin State Capitol</strong> was made in 1917 and houses all 3 branches of the Wisconsin state government.</p>
        <div>It is arguably one of the best state capitols I have seen.</div>
        <div>Wisconsin has enacted a height restriction preventing Madison buildings from blocking the Capitol view, so I can also get good pictures of the Madison Skyline, shown below.
        </div>
